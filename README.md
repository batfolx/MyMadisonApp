# MyMadisonApp
JMU MyMadison mobile Android app. 

**This application is not affiliated nor endorsed by James Madison University**. 

This application simply parses the HTML of the MyMadison webpage and displays the necessary information to the user in a simple, easy-to-use interface.

This app does not ever see any user credentials, logging in is done by opening up a browser, letting the user authenticate themselves with their eID and password and Duo 2FA, and using the returned authentication token stored as a Cookie to make subsequent requests to the website.
